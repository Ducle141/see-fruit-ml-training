                Apples contain only the natural fruit sugar, fructose. No added sugars!
                The fiber in apples slows the release of carbohydrates into the bloodstream, providing the energy you need over time without blood sugar spikes.
                
                Apples are a top food source of soluble fiber, which promotes cardiovascular and digestive health, and protects against cancer.
                The pectin in apples is a prebiotic, providing food for friendly gut bacteria.
                
                The phytochemicals in apples provide as much antioxidant health-protected capacity as a megadose of vitamin C.

                One-third of a medium avocado (50 g) has 80 calories and contributes nearly 20 vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients, making it a heart-healthy choice to help meet nutrient needs. Although phytonutrients are not essential, research suggests they may promote human health.
                
                The Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the American Heart Association recommend eating less nutrient-poor foods and limiting the amount of saturated fat, trans fat, added sugars and sodium consumed. The majority of fats in oneâ€™s diet should be heart-healthy monounsaturated or polyunsaturated; more than 75 percent of the fat in avocados is unsaturated, good fat.

                Bananas are one of the world's most appealing fruits. Global banana exports reached about 18 million tons in 2015, according to the United Nations. About half of them went to the United States and the European market. In the United States, each person eats 11.4 lbs. of bananas per year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, making it Americans' favorite fresh fruit.
                
                A wide variety of health benefits are associated with the curvy yellow fruit. Bananas are high in potassium and pectin, a form of fiber, said Laura Flores, a San Diego-based nutritionist. They can also be a good way to get magnesium and vitamins C and B6.
